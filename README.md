## dbt models for Divolte
This is a resolt of homework of Otus Data Engineer specialization, where I was to build some simple DWH layers over a Divolte raw data set using such tool as DBT.
The raw data I have got using previous lessons from Otus, namely I started Divolte/Kafka/Streamsets conrainers and clicked about two hundred times on a Divolte banner, and then chaned a little bit a Streamsets pipeline so that this clickstream data is saved locally.
